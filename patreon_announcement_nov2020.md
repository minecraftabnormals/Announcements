## Updates to our Patreon
Hey everyone! Our patreon will be recieving some updates, so that our patrons are getting rewarded more fairly, especially since one of our main rewards, testing the Cave Upgrade mod, has come to a halt.
### New Patreon Tier
The $10 Slabfish tier is being renamed to the Booflo tier, and the new $20 tier will take the name of Slabfish tier. This will not affect your current payment. If you are currently a $10 patron, you will not be charged more.

### In-Development Betas
All in-development betas are becoming a patron reward, rather than some betas being open to all and some betas being for patrons only. It will be much easier to organize this way and we noticed that in most cases, our supporters are the only ones actually testing the mods, rather than the majority who just use betas to get access to versions early. The mods will still be open-source to compile. $2+ patrons will get access to these betas.

### Abnormals Modded SMP
The Abnormals Modded SMP will be moving to a supporter SMP. We know this is hard and sad for some but unfortunately we have to make this decision, as our SMP can't support too many players and we have a lot of patrons, boosters, and devs. Nitro Boosters will get access as long as they are boosting the server and $5+ patrons will get permanent access to the SMP. We withold the right to ban you if you are creating a toxic environment on the SMP.

### Cosmetic Rewards
We'd like to announce a brand new reward... **Slabfish!**

$5+ patrons will have access to a customizable cosmetic Slabfish that will rest on their head when they have Abnormals Core present. The higher your tier, the more you have access to customizing.
* Tier 2 ($5) patrons get a swamp Slabfish with their choice of backpack color.
* Tier 3 ($10) patrons get a swamp Slabfish with their choice of backpack and sweater color.
* Tier 4 ($20) patrons get a Slabfish with their choice of type, backpack, and sweater color.

We hope you enjoy your little Slabfish friend.

## Closing Remarks
We know many of you will be upset due to the changes presented. It wasn't easy to make these decisions but we felt extremely bad having $10 and $5 patrons who got almost nothing different for supporting us for that much money. We truly appreciate all our fans and supporters and we hope you all understand.
